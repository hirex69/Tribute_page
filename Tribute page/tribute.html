<h2>A brief summary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj journey</h2>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji Maharaj carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji Maharaj implemented a competent and progressive administration with the help of a disciplined military and well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji Maharaj is well-known for his innovative military tactics that centered around non-conventional methods leveraging strategic factors like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.

<p>"सिंहाची चाल, गरुडाची नजर,
    स्त्रियांचा आदर, शत्रूचे गर्दन,
    असेच असावे मावळ्यांचे वर्तन,
    हीच छत्रपती शिवाजी महाराजांची शिकवण.
